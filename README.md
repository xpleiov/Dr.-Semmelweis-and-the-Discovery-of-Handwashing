# Introduction
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician who practiced in the mid-19th century. He observed that the incidence of puerperal fever, a deadly infection affecting women after childbirth, was significantly higher in clinics where doctors conducted autopsies before delivering babies. Dr. Semmelweis proposed that proper handwashing by medical professionals could prevent the spread of infections, leading to a substantial reduction in mortality rates.

This project aims to analyze historical data related to Dr. Semmelweis's work and create visualizations to highlight the impact of handwashing on mortality rates. It provides a deeper understanding of the importance of basic hygiene practices, which remain relevant in healthcare settings to this day.
